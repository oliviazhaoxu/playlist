                <p class="intro">Once upon a time, I was a "music journalist." (Lol.) At the risk of sounding like a bargain bin version of LCD Soundsystem's "Losing My Edge," I made decent money for several years reviewing bloggable .mp3s and writing SponCon at SXSW. I was a college student, and then I worked at a toy store in Seattle. I had a radio show called Fidelity on WMHC South Hadley 91.5FM and another radio show called Fidelity on Hollow Earth Radio pre-LPFM designation. The best thing about having a radio show that I don't think playlisting can quite match is putting a bit of yourself out there to be experienced anonymously. Otherwise, telling a story and wondering if anyone listening is putting up what you're putting down. Trusting any willing sentient being in broadcast radius to hear what you're saying or at least go along for the ride. I hope that you can trust me. And if you don't for whatever reason, while we're here together in this skip-enabled format you can just hit the next button.</p>
