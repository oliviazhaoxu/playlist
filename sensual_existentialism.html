                        <p>If you've never felt "the feeling," I honestly am happy for you. But I also feel bad because you're missing out on true psychic communion with this fucked up record. I actually don't know if I could tell you what "the feeling" is. I could theoretically tell you what my version of "the feeling" is, except that I never actually would. You might have your own version, which you don't have to tell me about, unless you want to. So I suggest you just listen to this song and decide if it twangs the chord inside you. Then if you really want to you can go listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/PlHrptO3wxU">the whole album</a> while lying down in the dark (highly recommended). </p>

Am I actually going to compare this to Slint's <a href="https://youtu.be/CuqEpjcBfaU">"Good Morning Captain"</a>? Yes: in how it explodes at the last minute (the strings!) and ends in the lyrical crux: "She was unhappy just as you were..."</p>
