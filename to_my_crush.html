                <h1>FIDELITY.III.17: TO MY CRUSH FROM TEN YEARS AGO</h1>
                <h2>Dear [redacted],</h2>
                <p>I wanted to say sorry that the last time I am ever likely to see you I was acting kind of weird and cold. In my defense, I was having a panic attack at the time. I'm also sorry for writing a very disturbing Brooklyn apocalypse novel in large part about you. I'm also sorry that I hated your music after a point and was really obvious about it. Overall, though it caused me a great deal of metaphysical angst, I am glad that we knew each other. I like to think that we needed each other when we knew each other, though maybe in kind of an uneven and imbalanced way. Thank you for making me feel so much at the time in my life when I was least equipped for it, so that it felt the worst and also the best. I am relieved to have gotten to the point where I am grateful for that and capable of thinking of you fondly. </p>
                <p>In this arena I also want to extend a monumental and sincere apology to everybody who tolerated me while I was totally insane about you. I really am deeply sorry that I was basically an insufferable gaping wound of radioactive ooze for such a long and incredibly stupid time. This playlist is for all of those people too. In fact, it's probably more about them than it is about you. </p>
                <p>Your friend,</p>
                <p>Gen</p>
