                <h1>FIDELITY.III.46.: LITERARY. </h1>
                <h2>I saw the new film adaptation of <i>Dune</i> a few weeks ago, and it reminded me of Grimes' first LP <i>Geidi Primes</i>, which is a Dune concept album, and actually the reason that I read the book to begin with. I just had to know more about the places and people that her songs were describing. That got me thinking about a playlist of songs based on books! A few classic novels (<i>Alice in Wonderland, 1984, The Catcher In the Rye</i>) inspired more songs than I ever knew before compiling this. There are some other more niche picks... and of course two of Led Zeppelin's <i>Lord of the Rings</i> referencing classics. Please enjoy!</h2>

                        <p>"Wouldn't it be nice to be Dorian Gray / Just for a day..." They really just had such great songs and were very aware of the construct of their own mythology and the place of that mythology in a broader art-historical context. And for that I can only applaud them. </p>

                        <p>I was going to say that this song is not really about the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80_rebours">A'Rebours</a> by Joris-Karl Huysmans - often translated in English to Against Nature. (I didn't truly dislike many of the books that I was assigned to read for college classes, but this was one of them.) A'Rebours the novel is a kind of foundational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decadent_movement">Decadent</a> text that's on the surface about one guy's very particular aesthetic obsessions but that is actually about retreating into a world of one's own creation. And the latter is what this song (and album!) is about. </p>

                        <p>13. Deerhunter, "Helicopter" from <i>Halcyon Digest</i>, 2010</p>
                        <p>Based on one of Dennis Cooper's mega-disturbing short stories about dissolute gay youth. (Does Dennis Cooper have any other kind of short story?) This was the first song I heard by this band that I liked. Listening to the rest of the album changed my entire life. I've probably said this before but one of the interesting things about Deerhunter is that they can pretty accurately be characterized as a Southern Gothic rock band, in the lineage of R.E.M.'s Fables of the Reconstruction... A fully actualized sonic interpretation of a predominantly literary movement.</p>

                        <p>The sometimes-cringe-inducing, excruciatingly pure and almost childish sincerity and simplicity of Ira Kaplan's lyrics seems to me an underrated element of what has made this band so good and so respected for so long.

                        <p>Susan Cooper's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Is_Rising_Sequence">The Dark is Rising</a> sequence was one of my favorite young adult fantasy series when I was a kid.

                        <p>Most of this album was inspired by Jeff Mangum's reading The Diary of Anne Frank and becoming obsessed with Anne's story. I think this song is sort of a thesis statement about why he was so inspired by her, and overall the continued resonance of her life. "It's so sad to see the world agree that they'd rather see their faces filled with flies / Oh when I long to keep white roses in their eyes..."</p>
