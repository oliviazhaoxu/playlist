                <h1>FIDELITY.III.59: SIT AROUND THE FIRE</h1>
                <p>Here is a two and a half hour playlist consisting of ten songs. They might not all necessarily be defined as "ambient," especially if we are going with Brian Eno's definition of "music that is as ignorable as it is interesting," but that is the most realistic bucket that can perhaps contain them all. Otherwise that bucket is summed up by this YouTube comment on one of the songs below, Basinski's "dlp 6": </p>

                <p>Overall, I wanted to underscore that people have been making what we might call "electronic music" for longer than we might expect (<a href="https://paulineoliveros1.bandcamp.com/track/time-perspectives-1959">as early as 1959 for Pauline Oliveros</a>) and that it has always been a genre characterized by pioneering female composers. This is the very definition of music that is Not For Everybody, but I hope you find at least one piece here that suits you. </p>

                        <p>Eno is supposedly the person who came up with the phrase "ambient music," even though he of course was not the first person to make it. This was his first album of ambient pieces, released a few years after he left Roxy Music.</p>

                        <p>9. William Basinski, "dlp 6" from The Disintegration Loops IV, 2003</p>
                        <p>This is my favorite ambient piece to put on and get work done. For me it's one of those things that evokes nostalgia for a place and time I have never been to. The six Disintegration Loops are the result of an accident in transferring field recordings from deteriorated magnetic tape to digital.</p>
